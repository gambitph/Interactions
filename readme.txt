No! While Interactions excels at animations, it's much more than that. It's a comprehensive interaction system that includes functional features like updating post meta, triggering DOM events, copying text to clipboard, and much more. You can build both visual effects and powerful functional features.

= Does it work with Elementor or other page builders? =  
No. Interactions is built specifically for the **WordPress block editor (Gutenberg)**.

= Can I add scroll animations to WordPress with this plugin? =  
Yes. You can animate blocks when they enter the viewport, fade in, slide in, or trigger other effects on scroll.

= Can I update post meta or custom fields with this plugin? =  
Yes! The premium version includes "Update Post Meta" and "Update User Meta" actions that let you modify database values without coding. Perfect for counters, user preferences, and dynamic content.

= Will it slow down my website? =  
No. Interactions only loads when they are used on the current page, in addition to this, only the effects you use are loaded, keeping performance fast.
